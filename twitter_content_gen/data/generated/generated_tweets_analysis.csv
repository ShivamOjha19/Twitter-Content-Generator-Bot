1,"Write an engaging tweet about 2025, going, work, what you do. Not a perfect ideaâ€”I've been writing about this in the past, and it doesn't seem to make any difference to me. Instead, I think it's not worth having your Twitter account taken away because it could hurt your reputations. The same goes for people who say something like ""the only idea that doesn't sound too good is a Trump-type tweet,"" and that's a joke. It's not an ideal one. It's the kind of tweet that should be retweeted only when you have the decency to tell the story. If you believe what your tweets say, then you're a coward, and I can't tell you how I feel about doing that with a certain audience. One way of doing it is to tell more stories from the point of view of people who have a different view of how I handle politics, but the point of doing it is to make us feel great about ourselves.

When you write an email every day you'll be surprised at how busy the world is. No more writing about the day you're working or having a few drinks. No more writing about how awesome your social life is. No more seeing a movie or seeing a play. No more taking your time to know what people want and need. No more getting things done for you. That's not how busy you are or how busy you are. 5. Don't worry about just reading an email and sending it to friends or family. It's not about taking your time. It's about what you think of people, about what you think you should be doing. In a world where people are more likely to read an email you could easily have a hard time not reading an email. Just like the average teenager reading an email may get mad all the time, like most teenagers reading an email may not get mad after several hundred words. 6. Ask yourself, is it a waste of your time to just read an email and","['life', 'numbers', 'making']",[],2024-12-22 19:55:46.601487
